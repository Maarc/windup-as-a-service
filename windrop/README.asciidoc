Windrop
==============================================================================================

What is it?
-----------

This sub-project contains the front-end of "windup-web". It is based on parts of the "https://github.com/juhoffma/dropspace" prototype.

This application is built using a HTML5 + REST approach. This uses a pure HTML client that interacts with with the application server via restful end-points (JAX-RS). This application also uses some of the latest HTML5 features and advanced JAX-RS. And since testing is just as important with client side as it is server side, this application uses QUnit to show you how to unit test your JavaScript.


Deploying the application
-------------------------

First you need to start the JBoss container. To do this, run
  
    $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
  
or if you are using windows
 
    $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.bat
    
To deploy the application, you first need to produce the archive to deploy using the following Maven goal:

    mvn package

You can now deploy the artifact by executing the following command:

    mvn jboss-as:deploy

The client application will be running at the following URL <http://localhost:8080/windrop/>.

To undeploy run this command:

    mvn jboss-as:undeploy
