Frames is a bare-bones library. Luckily, its part of a larger ecosystem of graph technologies. When using Frames, you will find yourself making use of framed domain objects and "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com.

h2. Getting Indexes

Frames has no notion of indexes. To obtain an index, use Blueprints.

```java
IndexedGraph graph = framedGraph.getBaseGraph(); // get reference to graph
Index index = graph.getIndex("myIndex", Vertex.class);
```
